Unfor- tunately , the limited availability of GPCR–ligand structures (below 500) [ 5] and the difficulty in obtaining reliable GPCR structures because of their embedding in the lipid membrane pose significant challenges for developing structure-based GPCR– ligand prediction models. It is worth noting that the unique properties of GPCRs compared to soluble proteins in protein– ligand binding further complicate the modeling process.
