# Agentic Clinical Evidence Navigator
**Overview**  
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for biomedical research. It dynamically scrapes PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, embeds findings in a Chroma vector database, and uses Ollama-powered LLMs with CrewAI agents to analyze and synthesize results into actionable clinical reports.
